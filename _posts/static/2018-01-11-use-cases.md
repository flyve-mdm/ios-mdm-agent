## 1. Invitation - Enrollment

Once the invitation is sent from the Flyve MDM Dashboard or GLPI Plugin, the enrollment is made through the deeplink or QR code received.

* If the Agent is installed in the device, it will Open with the App.

* If it isn't, it will take the user to the AppStore to download it.

Once it is enrolled the Agent will sent the information of the user to the backend and also its serial number or its UUID.

## 2. Management

The management of your mobile fleet is through the Flyve MDM Dashboard or GLPI plugin, which connects to the Agents on the devices of your fleet.

Through the MQTT, a Machine to Machine (M2M) protocol the Agent is capable of maintaining a connection with the backend, thanks to the concepts of will and testament of the protocol.

When there is a connectivity with the broker the Agent will have an Online status and will be able to send a message to the broker, when it is disconnected the broker will send an Offline status on behalf of the Agent.

### 2.1 Files and Apps

Once the Fleet is applied with the deployment of the apps and files, the Agent will receive a MQTT message with the information to start the download using an HTTP request.

## 3. User information

You can only update the user information from the Agent, such as phone number, name and emails.

## 4. Unenrollment

To unenroll an Agent, a MQTT message is sent to the device running this agent to process unenrollment. Once the unenrollment is done, the agent sends a MQTT message to acknowledge the unenrollment request.

The backend waits for this acknowledgment to actually delete the agent from the database. The delay to send this acknowledgment is undetermined but should happen because the device is in the end of a cycle but still owned by legitimate user and is used in normal operations.
