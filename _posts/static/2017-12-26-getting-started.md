### MQ Telemetry Transport

We implemented the MQTT protocol, which is useful for connections with remote locations since it was designed as an extremely lightweight message transport. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers. Thanks to it, the Agent is capable of maintaining a connection with the backend.

### Information

The Agent will display the relevant information, the user will be able to see the Supervisor information and edit his own
